      And Danny ran into some complications He falls asleep during conversations
      He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation The worst thing is that
      I'm in the same situation And all I do is sit and think about you If I
      knew what you'd do Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes It's not
      living, if it's not with you And Danny says we're living in a simulation
      But he works in a petrol station (selling petrol) He says it all began
      with his operation And I know you think you're sly, but you need some
      imagination And all I do is sit and think about you If I knew what you'd
      do Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes It's not living, if it's not
      with you All I do is sit and drink without you If I choose, then I'll lose
      Distract my brain from the terrible news It's not living, if it's not with
      you I can't stop sweating or control my feet Got a twenty-stone monkey
      that I just can't beat I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat And
